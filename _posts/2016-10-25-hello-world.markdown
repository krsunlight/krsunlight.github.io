Hello guys. Thanks to Github Pages, I've managed to set up my tech blog. My current plan is to post any thought I've got about software to this blog. Game-related stuff is also gonna appear here! In fact, my next post is very likely to be a Minecraft client setup guide for playing on my own server.
